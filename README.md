Product Webpage - Working with Promises and Fetch API

Introduction:
In this challenge, I will build a Product Webpage using JavaScript that displays product information retrieved from an external API. This task gives experience with Promises, fetch(), and handling asynchronous operations using .then() and .catch() to load and display data from the JavaScript Store Products API.

Business Case:
Scenario: A business wants to display a list of products on their website. The product details, including company name, product price, product name, and product image, are available through a public API. Your task is to build a webpage that retrieves and displays this information dynamically using the JavaScript Store Products API.
